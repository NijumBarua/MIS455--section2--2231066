    <p class= "TheImage4">Ziaur Rahman[a] (19 January 1936 – 30 May 1981) was a Bangladeshi military officer and politician who served as the President of Bangladesh from 1977 until his assassination. He was the founder of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and served as its chairman until his assassination. He previously served as the second chief of army staff from 1975 to 1978 with a minor break. <img src="Images/Flag of Bangladesh.jpg" alt=""> He promised reform and a return to democratic elections, but an attempted coup in November 1977 slowed the process. Nevertheless, eight months later Bangladesh’s first elections held under universal suffrage took place. The results endorsed Zia’s politics. During Zia’s presidency, Bangladesh’s relations with Pakistan improved, though there were continued border tensions with India. Zia was assassinated during a coup attempt led by Maj. Gen. Mohammad Abdul Manzoor, who in 1971 had fought beside him in the battle to win independence for Bangladesh.</p>
